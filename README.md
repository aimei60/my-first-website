## Sri Lanka's Botanical Gardens Website

I was inspired by my family holiday to create this website. All pictures were taken by myself. I wanted to showcase some of the exotic plants I had seen. 

Credits:
* Background pictures for the site were taken from the https://www.pexels.com/
* Map of Sri Lanka was taken from Google images
