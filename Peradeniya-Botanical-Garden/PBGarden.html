        <div class="description">Located in the city of Kandy, this magnificent garden is an attraction for many. The garden is known for its beautiful orchids, herbs, medicinal plants and gigantic trees. The vast 147 acres was too much to walk in one day, so we took a tourist kart around the gardens. It was a peaceful place and it was wonderful to see the monkeys and other wildlife just going about their business.</div>
